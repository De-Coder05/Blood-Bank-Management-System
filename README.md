## Project Overview

This project provides an end-to-end demonstration of a Database Management System, covering the essential components, layered architecture, and practical database operations. The aim is to showcase how a DBMS manages, secures, and optimizes data for various users and applications.

---

## Features

- Data definition, manipulation, and retrieval (CRUD operations)
- Transaction management with ACID properties
- Data security and integrity controls
- Multi-user concurrency support
- Data backup and recovery mechanisms
- Performance optimization (indexing, partitioning, caching)
- User roles: Administrator, Developer, End-user

---

## DBMS Architecture

The project follows the standard three-tier DBMS architecture:

| Layer           | Description                                                                                   |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| External Layer  | User interface/views; allows different users to see data as per their requirements           |
| Conceptual Layer| Logical structure of the database; defines entities, relationships, and constraints          |
| Internal Layer  | Physical storage of data; handles indexing, partitioning, and low-level data organization    |

---

## Components of the DBMS

| Component               | Description                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hardware                | Physical devices (servers, storage, network, I/O devices)                                                    |
| Software                | DBMS software (e.g., MySQL, Oracle), OS, network software, application programs                              |
| Data                    | User data, metadata (data about data), application metadata                                                  |
| Procedures              | Instructions for setup, backup, recovery, access control, and report generation                              |
| Database Access Language| SQL or similar languages for querying and manipulating data                                                  |
| People                  | DB administrators, developers, end-users                                                                     |

## Data Model & Schema

- **Entity-Relationship (ER) model** for conceptual design
- **Relational schema** for logical design
- **Example entities:** User, Product, Order, Transaction
- **Relationships:** One-to-many (User–Order), Many-to-many (Product–Order)
- **Constraints:** Primary keys, foreign keys, unique, not-null

---

## Functional Requirements

- User registration and authentication
- Data entry, update, and deletion with validation
- Querying data with filters and sorting
- Transaction support (commit, rollback)
- Access control based on user roles
- Reporting and analytics (e.g., sales reports, user activity)
- Backup and restore functionality

---

## Implementation Details

- Tables created using SQL DDL statements
- CRUD operations via SQL queries
- Transaction management ensuring ACID properties:
  - **Atomicity:** All steps in a transaction complete or none do
  - **Consistency:** Database remains in a valid state
  - **Isolation:** Concurrent transactions do not interfere
  - **Durability:** Completed transactions are permanent
- Indexes and partitions for performance
- Triggers and stored procedures for automation

---

## Optimization & Security

- Indexing and data partitioning for fast access
- Caching frequently accessed data
- Access control: Role-based permissions
- Data encryption and audit trails for security
- Validation rules to ensure data integrity

---

## Backup & Recovery

- Regular automated backups (full and incremental)
- Recovery scripts to restore data after failure
- Backup verification and logs


---

## Deployment & Usage

1. Install a compatible DBMS (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)
2. Import schema and data scripts from `/schemas` and `/data`
3. Execute procedures and queries as needed
4. Use provided sample queries for testing and reporting
